remove the _ off the folder name (_streamermode to streamermode) to enable streamer mode

this removes all possibly trackable information while playing the game whilst live

i also personally suggest you turn off chat (hud_saytext_time 0) and voice chat (voice_enable 0) alongside this

another suggestion: please fully restart your game before toggling this on/off, it screws with a lot of things. -techno
